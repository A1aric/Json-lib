				JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight
				data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read
				and write. It is easy for machines to parse and
				generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript
				Programming Language, Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition -
				December 1999. JSON is a text format that is completely
				language independent but uses conventions that are
				familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages,
				including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python,
				and many others.
				<br />
				These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange
				language.
			</p>
			<p>
				This library is based on the work by Douglas Crockford
				in<a href="http://www.json.org/java">http://www.json.org/java</a>
				, adding support for java arrays and object graphs. With
				this library it is possible to transform the following
				java structures to JSON: java beans, java arrays,
				collections, maps; composites of the 4 previous types.
				<br />
				The main driver for this library is to provide the means
				to transform data between a server and an AJAX enabled
				application.
